# Open Science in Practice 2017

- 25-29 September 2017, EPFL Campus
- https://osip2017.epfl.ch/

## Background

Open science is an umbrella term. It describes a multitude of
initiatives trying to harvest the potential of digital technologies to
change how knowledge is produced, disseminated and reused. These
solutions are often work in progress and challenge a status quo where
the publication process leads to static, often behind pay wall, text
documents that do not represent the complexity of the research
process.

In an attempt to restore best practice in the production and
dissemination of knowledge, a transition to a more open and
reproducible research is desirable and requires new incentives and
infrastructures. This transition is mostly a cultural change, which is
best supported by initiatives stemming from the scientific community
itself (bottom-up approach). To a lesser extent, it is also a
technical issue that requires the development of new tools based on
state-of-the art digital technologies.

## My talks: *An early career researcher's view on modern and open scholarship*

I will be posting my slides here.

### Open Science in Practice 2017

> We would like it if you could intervene as third speaker with a 45
> minutes presentation (+15 minutes questions) on your motivations for
> adopting open science practices.

### Open Science at the EPFL library

I will be giving a sceond talk (15 + 5 minutes questions) at the Rolex
Learning Center in the evening.
