I will also be giving a shorter version of this talk at the EPFL
library in the evening.

## An early career researcher's view on modern and open scholarship

### Abstract

If *research is the by-product of researchers getting promoted* (a
quote
by
[David Barron, Professor of Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Barron),
Prof. Leslie Carr, personal communication), then shouldn't we, early
career researchers (ECRs), focus on promotion and being docile
academic citizens rather than aiming for the more nobel cause of
pursuing research to understand the world that surrounds us, and
disseminate our findings using modern channels?
Indeed,
[I have already argued](https://lgatto.github.io/open-research-project/) that
a critical point that is failing us, is the academic promotion of open
research and open researcher, as a way to promote a more rigorous and
sound research process and tackle the reproducibility crisis. In this
talk, I will present the case for open scholarship from an early
carrer researcher's perspective, pointing out that being an open
researcher is not only the *right* thing to do, but is also the *best*
thing to do.

## About the meeting

Open science is an umbrella term. It describes a multitude of
initiatives trying to harvest the potential of digital technologies to
change how knowledge is produced, disseminated and reused. These
solutions are often work in progress and challenge a status quo where
the publication process leads to static, often behind pay wall, text
documents that do not represent the complexity of the research
process.

In an attempt to restore best practice in the production and
dissemination of knowledge, a transition to a more open and
reproducible research is desirable and requires new incentives and
infrastructures. This transition is mostly a cultural change, which is
best supported by initiatives stemming from the scientific community
itself (bottom-up approach). To a lesser extent, it is also a
technical issue that requires the development of new tools based on
state-of-the art digital technologies.
